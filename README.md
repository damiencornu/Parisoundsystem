DEV Part
--------
 - Debug interface : Boolean **DEBUGGERINTERFACE** in viewControllers
 - Sounds are set through **Sounds-List.plist** which is an array of dictionnary
 - To add a song w/ location simply add an object in the .plist file + add the song to the project in /assets/sounds (be sure "Copy into destination folder" is checked)
